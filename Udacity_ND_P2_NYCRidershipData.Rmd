### Section 1: Statistical Test
1.1 Which statistical test did you use to analyze the NYC subway data? Did you use a one-tail or a two-tail P value? What is the null hypothesis? What is your p-critical value?
We used a Mann-Whitney U-test to analyze the difference between ridership on rainy vs. non-rainy days. It is a two-tailed test with the null hypothesis that the two samples come from populations with the same distribution. The p-critical value is 0.05.
1.2 Why is this statistical test applicable to the dataset? In particular, consider the assumptions that the test is making about the distribution of ridership in the two samples.
This test is appropriate because it does not assume that the distribution of ridership is normal, and we saw with a quick histogram that the distribution is likely not normal. 
1.3 What results did you get from this statistical test? These should include the following numerical values: p-values, as well as the means for each of the two samples under test.
The mann-whitney test gave a p-value 0.025. The mean of ridership with rain was 1105.45, and the mean without rain was 1090.28.
1.4 What is the significance and interpretation of these results?
At the 95% confidence level, we can reject the null hyopthesis and conclude that the distributions for ridership are different with and without rain. There is only a 2.5% chance of getting a U-statistic that large for samples from identical population distributions.
### Section 2: Linear Regression
2.1 What approach did you use to compute the coefficients theta and produce prediction for ENTRIESn_hourly in your regression model:
OLS using Statsmodels or Scikit Learn

2.2 What features (input variables) did you use in your model? Did you use any dummy variables as part of your features?
2.3 Why did you select these features in your model? We are looking for specific reasons that lead you to believe that
the selected features will contribute to the predictive power of your model.
Your reasons might be based on intuition. For example, response for fog might be: “I decided to use fog because I thought that when it is very foggy outside people might decide to use the subway more often.”
Your reasons might also be based on data exploration and experimentation, for example: “I used feature X because as soon as I included it in my model, it drastically improved my R2 value.”  
2.4 What are the parameters (also known as "coefficients" or "weights") of the non-dummy features in your linear regression model?
2.5 What is your model’s R2 (coefficients of determination) value?
2.6 What does this R2 value mean for the goodness of fit for your regression model? Do you think this linear model to predict ridership is appropriate for this dataset, given this R2  value?
